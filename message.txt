Dear Mac users, 
Sorry but it's hard to make mac versions of the desktop client since MacOS uses a 
system of file directory called "Symlinks". Symlinks on Windows can be enabled but 
it's very confusing to do it. So hopefully in the future, we can figure
out how to do it properly.

Have a nice day,
