            <h3><em>What is it?</em></h3>
            <i>The Deeeep.io Desktop Client is a desktop client for deeeep.io(duh) built with ElectronJS!</i>
            <br>
            <i>You don't have to open up deeeep.io on your browser anymore!</i>
            <br>
            <h3 class="Benefits"><em>Benefits</em></h3>
            <br>
            <i>So currently there are only 2 perks for the app, but the team will be adding more in the future!</i>
            <br>
            <i>You don't have to open the game in your browser anymore and you even get discord-rpc!</i>
            <br>
            <i>and btw, the app is actively under development</i>
            <h3><em>Safety</em></h3>
            <br>
            <i>This question was asked by some beta testers, so I wanted to clear it up.</i>
            <br>
            <i>The client is completely safe for your computer, as it is 100% managed by SirReadsALot</i>
            <br>
            <i>and the other team members. We don't grab your personal information(no use for it).</i>
            <br>
            <i>Now, on windows it will show that it is dangerous(but it is safe)</i>
            <br>
            <i>but all you have to do to bypass this is click on "More Info" and click "Run Anyway" and enjoy it :]</i>
